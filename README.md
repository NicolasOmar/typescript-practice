# Typescript Practice
Repository created to record my practice learning React with exercises based on the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript) of [Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/).

## Requirements
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v16.13.2 or above

 ## Setup
After cloning the repo, go to the created folder and install the node packages.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NicolasOmar/typescript-practice.git
cd typescript-practice
npm run setup-all
```
`setup-all` is the command to install all the projects, but if you want to do it one by one, you can change that last line for one of the following:
| App Setup | Command |
| ------ | ------ |
| All | `npm run setup-all` |
| Base project | `npm run setup-base-project` |

## How to run it
To run any specific exercise, execute the following command in the project´s folder:
```sh
npm start
```

## Repo Structure & what i learned in each exercise
 - Base project (`1-base-project` folder)
   - Create, code and compile a `.ts` file into javascript
   - Understanding of `Core Types`: `number`, `string` and `boolean`
